        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>My name is Akshith "Akki" Karanam, and I am committed to mastering the art of computer science and everything it has to offer in solving real-world issues and improving lives through innovating technology. I aspire to build a career in programming with the goal of reaching the height of a senior AI developer or a Java architect, and eventually transitioning into entrepreneurship and business. Above all, my goal is to make those who supported me proud while fulfilling all the bucket list items I have yet to conquer that I consider trophies for my success.
